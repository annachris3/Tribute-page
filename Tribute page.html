<h2 class="introducao">
    Kaplicky was born on 18 April 1937 in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Between 1956 and 1962 he studied at the College of Applied Arts and Architecture and Design (VSUP) in Prague, receiving a Diploma in Architecture. 
    He worked in private practice in Czechoslovakia between 1964 and 1968. In the wake of the Prague Spring, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, he escaped to London in September 1968 with fellow architect Jaroslav Vokoun carrying only US$100 and a few pairs of socks.

<p class="citacao">"I also don't think you need to go anywhere particular to be creative; 
    people just use that as an excuse. But I do think a lot of creativity depends on your relationships with other people, your personal relationships, your partner or whatever. Your personal happiness or unhappiness comes out in your work,
     it's a reflection of your emotional state and you can't separate the two." <br>Jan Kaplicky (1937-2009)</p>
